## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program, I have progressed from learning foundational programming concepts to designing, enhancing, and critically evaluating complete software systems. This capstone represents the culmination of that growth. Rather than simply presenting completed coursework, this ePortfolio demonstrates my ability to analyze existing systems, identify weaknesses, and implement meaningful improvements aligned with industry practices.

One of the most important skills I developed is the ability to move beyond "does it work?" and toward "is it maintainable, secure, scalable, and well-designed?" Across my artifacts, I focused on improving architecture, strengthening data integrity, refining algorithms, and applying secure coding practices. Each enhancement required me to evaluate trade-offs, justify design decisions, and document my reasoning clearly.

This capstone also reinforced the importance of professional communication. Whether explaining algorithmic decisions, documenting system enhancements, or performing a formal code review, I learned to present technical work in a structured manner suitable for professional or academic settings. This portfolio reflects not just technical competence, but growth in critical thinking, software quality standards, and professional readiness.

## Overview of the Capstone Experience
The capstone required selecting prior coursework artifacts and enhancing them to demonstrate deeper technical mastery. Rather than building something entirely new, I strengthened existing systems by improving design quality, algorithmic efficiency, and database structure.

For each artifact, I analyzed the original implementation, identified its limitations, and implemented targeted improvements. These enhancements included architectural restructuring, improved data modeling, algorithm refinement, input validation, and security-focused updates — each deliberate and tied to specific program outcomes.

The result is a portfolio that demonstrates practical software engineering skills across multiple domains: system design, algorithm development, database management, security awareness, and professional documentation.

## Program Outcomes Demonstrated

### 1. Collaborative Environments & Communication
The code review component of this portfolio demonstrates structured technical analysis, constructive critique, and the ability to communicate improvement strategies clearly — the kind of communication expected in a professional development team.

Each artifact also includes detailed documentation explaining what was improved, why the changes were necessary, and how they enhanced the system. Rather than listing features, I focused on presenting information in a structured format that would be accessible to stakeholders, teammates, or instructors. The clarity and organization of these explanations reflect my readiness to collaborate effectively in professional software environments.

### 2. Professional-Quality Communication

Each artifact includes detailed documentation explaining what was improved, why the changes were necessary, and how they enhanced the system. Rather than simply listing features, I focused on presenting information in a structured and professional format.

This portfolio reflects the ability to write technical documentation suitable for stakeholders, instructors, or development teams. The clarity and organization of the explanations demonstrate readiness to communicate effectively in professional software environments.

### 3. Algorithms and Problem Solving
The Algorithms & Data Structures enhancement demonstrates my ability to analyze performance limitations and implement improved solutions. I evaluated the original implementation, identified inefficiencies, and redesigned components to improve logical flow and computational efficiency.

Beyond restoring functionality, I considered algorithmic complexity, correctness, and maintainability. This reflects growth in analytical thinking and structured problem-solving — skills fundamental to advanced computer science practice.


### 4. Computing Tools and Industry Practices
Throughout this capstone, I applied industry-relevant tools and practices including version control, structured documentation, modular design principles, and organized project structure. Enhancements were implemented with maintainability and scalability in mind rather than quick fixes.

The portfolio structure itself reflects professional presentation standards. Code, documentation, and analysis are organized clearly, demonstrating familiarity with tools and workflows used in modern software development environments.


### 5. Security Mindset

Security was integrated from the design stage rather than applied retroactively. I considered potential vulnerabilities such as improper data handling, insufficient input validation, and structural weaknesses in database design, then implemented preventative measures to address them directly.

This demonstrates a shift from writing functional code to writing resilient, secure software — an approach that treats security as a core design requirement, not an optional layer.



## Career Readiness and Future Goals

This capstone demonstrates my ability to evaluate existing systems, identify weaknesses, and implement structured improvements that align with industry standards. The work here reflects practical readiness to contribute in professional software development roles.

In my future, I wish to focus on working towards becoming more fluent in high-performance computing, cross-platform development as well as parallel sorting algorithms. I have found a topic that I am very interested in and I want to further my knowledge and experience in those areas. There is so much that can be learned and created at the intersection of cache friendly sorting and user-centered application design.
