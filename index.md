## Professional Self-Assessment

Throughout the Computer Science program, I have progressed from learning foundational programming concepts to designing, enhancing, and critically evaluating complete software systems. This capstone represents the culmination of that growth. Rather than simply presenting completed coursework, this ePortfolio demonstrates my ability to analyze existing systems, identify weaknesses, and implement meaningful improvements aligned with industry practices.

One of the most important skills I developed is the ability to move beyond “does it work?” and toward “is it maintainable, secure, scalable, and well-designed?” Across my artifacts, I focused on improving architecture, strengthening data integrity, refining algorithms, and applying secure coding practices. The enhancements I implemented required me to evaluate trade-offs, justify design decisions, and document my reasoning clearly.

This capstone also reinforced the importance of professional communication. Whether documenting system enhancements, explaining algorithmic decisions, or performing a formal code review, I learned how to present technical work in a structured, professional manner suitable for industry or graduate-level expectations. Overall, this portfolio reflects not just technical competency, but growth in critical thinking, software quality standards, and professional readiness.

## Overview of the Capstone Experience
The capstone required selecting prior coursework artifacts and enhancing them to demonstrate deeper technical mastery. Instead of building something entirely new, I focused on strengthening existing systems by improving design quality, algorithmic efficiency, and database structure.

For each artifact, I analyzed the original implementation, identified limitations, and implemented targeted improvements. These enhancements included architectural restructuring, improved data modeling, algorithm refinement, validation logic, and security-focused updates. Each improvement was intentional and aligned with specific program outcomes.

The final result is a portfolio that demonstrates practical software engineering skills across multiple domains: system design, algorithm development, database management, security awareness, and professional documentation.

## Program Outcomes Demonstrated

### 1. Collaborative Environments & Communication
The code review component of this portfolio demonstrates structured technical analysis, constructive critique, and the ability to explain improvement strategies in a way that would be appropriate for a development team environment.

Additionally, the documentation included in each artifact reflects professional-level written communication. Clear explanations of enhancements, design decisions, and trade-offs show my ability to collaborate effectively by making my reasoning transparent to other developers.

### 2. Professional-Quality Communication

Each artifact includes detailed documentation explaining what was improved, why the changes were necessary, and how they enhanced the system. Rather than simply listing features, I focused on presenting information in a structured and professional format.

This portfolio reflects the ability to write technical documentation suitable for stakeholders, instructors, or development teams. The clarity and organization of the explanations demonstrate readiness to communicate effectively in professional software environments.

### 3. Algorithms and Problem Solving
The Algorithms & Data Structures enhancement demonstrates my ability to analyze performance limitations and implement improved solutions. I evaluated the original implementation, identified inefficiencies, and redesigned components to improve logical flow and computational effectiveness.

Beyond coding functionality, I considered algorithmic complexity, correctness, and maintainability. This reflects growth in analytical thinking and structured problem-solving — skills that are fundamental to advanced computer science practice.


### 4. Computing Tools and Industry Practices
Throughout this capstone, I applied industry-relevant tools and practices including version control, structured documentation, modular design principles, and organized project structure. Enhancements were implemented with maintainability and scalability in mind rather than quick fixes.

The portfolio structure itself reflects professional presentation standards. Code, documentation, and analysis are organized clearly, demonstrating familiarity with tools and workflows used in modern software development environments.


### 5. Security Mindset

A key improvement across artifacts was the integration of secure coding practices. I considered potential vulnerabilities such as improper data handling, insufficient validation, and structural weaknesses in database design.

Rather than treating security as an afterthought, I evaluated how the system could fail or be misused and implemented preventative measures accordingly. This demonstrates a shift from writing functional code to writing resilient, secure software.

## Portfolio Structure

This ePortfolio is organized into the following sections:

* **Code Review** – Analysis and critique of an existing codebase
* **Software Design & Engineering** – Enhancement focusing on architecture and maintainability
* **Algorithms & Data Structures** – Enhancement emphasizing algorithmic improvement
* **Databases** – Enhancement centered on data persistence and management

## Career Readiness and Future Goals

This capstone reflects my readiness to transition into professional software development roles. I am confident in my ability to evaluate existing systems, identify weaknesses, and implement structured improvements that align with industry standards.

In my future, I wish to focus on working towards becoming more fluent in high-performance computing, cross-platform development as well as parallel sorting algorithms. I have found a topic that I am very interested in and I want to further my knowledge and experience in those areas. There is so much that can be learned and created at the intersection of cache friendly sorting and user-centered application design.
